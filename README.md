### What is this?

This is a booking system app for the course 1DV42E at the Linnaeus University. This app is being developed for a customer whom has set the terms for the used technology.
   
In booking system users will be able to book resources, locations with different furnishing, food/meals for customers or them selves.
   
The goal is to create an Android app with a user interface that also should work well in all major browsers on desktop computers.
   
### Tech used

#### Frontend
At the time beeing we are using the [Ionic 1](http://ionic.io/) framework with Angular 1.X. We are coding in ES2015 with [babel](https://babeljs.io/) in some extent. As Ionic 2 gets more stable we will be looking into converting this project into it. We use a set of [ESLINT](http://eslint.org/) rules to keep the code nice and fresh.

#### Backend
The backend is built using [ASP.NET webapi 2](http://www.asp.net/web-api) with ADO.NET. All data is stored in a MS SQL database. Manipulation to the data is done through a set of MS SQL stored procedures.
